## DanQuest:
- Coming soon.

Run in IDE:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

Run for deployment:


```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
